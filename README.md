# Aqara Gateway/Hub (G2H, M1S, M2) integration for Home Assistant

Control Zigbee devices from Home Assistant with **Aqara Gateway (ZHWG15LM, ZHWG12LM, ZNSXJ12LM)**.

This integration was based on the development of @AlexxIT(https://github.com/AlexxIT/XiaomiGateway3/), Thanks Alex.

**ATTENTION:** The component **only works on modified firmware (M1S, M2). For G2H, you need to wired out the UART, then login to gateway to enable telnetd.**.

The method to flash modified firmware will coming soon.

Gateway support **Zigbee 3**.

**Attention:** The component is under active development.
